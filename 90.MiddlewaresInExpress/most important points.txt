Routes -->
Routes decide which code should run for which URL (link).
Routes tell your program what to do when a user opens a page.

Middleware -->

Middleware checks things before your main code runs.
Middleware is a helper function that runs before your main code when a request comes.

User request → Middleware → Main program → Response

✅ Simple Example (Real-life)

Imagine you are entering a college:

    You come to the gate

    Security checks your ID ✅

    Then you are allowed inside

That security check is middleware.
